# Walmart Sales Data Analytics Project 2025

# Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmart sales data to uncover insights into customer purchasing behavior, seasonal trends, and product performance. The dataset is processed, cleaned, and visualized using the OS module to manage relative path files, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.


# Data Sources
Dataset_1.zip (walmart.csv) (raw data)

Dataset_2.zip (walmart.csv) (raw data)

cleaned_walmart_data.csv: cleaned data after preprocessing.

cleaned_walmart_sales_data.csv: cleaned data after preprocessing

combined_walmart_data.csv: Merged data from cleaned_walmart_data and cleaned_walmart_sales_data.

Walmart Sales Jupyter Notebook.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook used for data analysis.


# Tools & Technologies Used

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for code execution and analysis.

myenv: A custom virtual environment for dependency management and reproducibility.

OS module for managing relative files

Python (Pandas,Matplotlib, and Seaborn): Data cleaning, manipulation, and basic visualizations.

ScalarFormatter: Used for formatting axis labels in Matplotlib visualizations (already included).


# Key Analyses

Customer Spending Patterns

Grouped by Age, Gender, and User_ID to analyze total and average spending.

Created visualizations of spending distribution.

Product Performance

Identified top-selling product categories.

Sales Trends & Seasonal Insights

Evaluated sales across holidays and non-holiday periods.


# How to Use the Project
setup environment: (virtual) myenv, python 3.10.12, pandas 2.0.3, ZIPfile, matplotlib, seaborn

source myenv/Scripts/activate (command activates the virtual environment)

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn command (scalarformatter included in matplotlib)

Confirm base directory and file names to import datsets via relative file paths

Relative paths will save files to extracted_files and base directories

Run the Jupyter Notebook to perform data cleaning and basic visualizations.


# Future Improvements

Integrate machine learning for predictive analytics.

Expand the dataset with external economic indicators.

Automate data updates for real-time analysis.
